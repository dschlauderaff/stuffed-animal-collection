# stuffed-animal-collection
Sinatra project started originally to track stuffed animals belonging to users. After working on it for a bit, I realized it's actually a program to associate any toy with an owner. As a father of three boys, I can see a need to be able to definitively establish what toys belong to which child. The program is written in a way that all owners can be viewed, as well as all toys, but only the owner can make changes to a toy, including assigning it to a new owner. Useful for a parent account to create toys, then assign them to a child's account.

The app was styled using drop-in-css by webdevjeffus (https://github.com/webdevjeffus/drop-in-css).
